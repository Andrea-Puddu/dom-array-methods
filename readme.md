Project to teach high order array methods and DOM manipulation

## Udemy Course

I made this project at online course [Build 20 mini frontend projects from scratch with HTML5, CSS & JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/) by Brad Traversy.
I added 1 button to refresh the page and added try/catch on the async function getRandomUser

## Project Specifications

- Fetch random users from the [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me) API
- Use forEach() to loop and output user/wealth
- Use map() to double wealth
- Use filter() to filter only millionaires
- Use sort() to sort by wealth
- Use reduce() to add all wealth
